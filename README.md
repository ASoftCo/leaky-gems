# A list of gems that have memory issues (but not actual leaks)

It appears some contributors submit gems with known memory issues, but not actual leaks. While those issues don't qualify as leaks they may still be important. I prefer listing them here to help other developers rather than just hiding them.

Links to known memory issues (gems are listed alphabetically):
- [axlsx](https://github.com/randym/axlsx/issues/276)
- [delayed_job >= 4.06](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/issues/776)
- [libxml-ruby > 2.8.0 with Nokogiri RC3](http://webuild.envato.com/blog/tracking-down-ruby-heap-corruption/)
- [newrelic_rpm >= 3.9.4, <= 3.9.7](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/client-using-large-amount-of-memory/9307)
- [sequel >= 2.12.0](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/issues/1139)


# Contributing

The format is the following:
